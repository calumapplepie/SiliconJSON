They do tomfoolery with nibbles and lookups as part of their layout tape stage 1 building
which i mean, sure, cool, whatever.  But on an FPGA, 10 comparasions and 10 ORs is cheap.

Handlers say whether or not they're done, and output a 'half-control' that controls.. half of a struct
or string or something writer.

more work needed ofc.
