# Testing Infrastructure ideas
- Make as giant C source files, using literals (script ?)
- Somehow force data into boot image
 + Elf sections?
 + Seems to be impossible to do reasonably
- Make as SD card
 + Xylinx IPs and APIs
 + Filesystem
 + Extensible
 - Bottlenecked at SD card - must load into RAM
 - More complicated code
- Stream data in over ethernet
 + thats not a test, thats a finished product
